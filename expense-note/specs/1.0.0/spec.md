# Expense note design document

## 1. Document information

| Item | Content |
|---|---|
| Product version | 1.0.0 |
| Document revision | 1 |
| Author | Open Reach Tech Inc. |
| Question language | English |

**Project name: `expense-note`**


## 2. Repository layout

| Repository | Origin | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `expense-note-backend` | renchan | the API, and it holds the DB |
| `expense-note-frontend-staff` | furo | the screens a member of staff uses |

### 2.1 Servers

| Server | protocol | consumer |
|---|---|---|
| `staff-graphql` | GraphQL | `frontend-staff` |

One server, one consumer. There is no REST server: nothing here is a file transfer, a redirect or a third party that cannot speak GraphQL, so the default stands.


## 3. Actors and roles

| Actor | Identified by | Roughly how many | Inside / outside |
|---|---|---|---|
| member of staff | an email address and password issued by an operator; there is no sign-up | 20, 50 foreseen | inside |

There is no second actor. Accounts are created by whoever operates the deployment, outside the product, so the operator never signs in and no screen is built for them.


## 4. Implementation scope

### Built this time (1.0.0)

- signing in and signing out
- recording an expense, correcting it, removing it, and reading back one's own entries
- a chosen month's entries with their total

### Out of scope for now (to be built later)

- approval by a manager → planned for 1.1.0. **Seam:** an expense carries a status from the first migration, holding one value now, and every read goes through it rather than assuming a recorded expense is a final one
- exporting a month for a claim form (CSV) → planned for 1.2.0. **Seam:** a month's entries and its total are produced by one operation, which an export calls rather than re-deriving
- a photograph of the receipt on an expense → needs object storage, which this version does not declare. **Seam:** nothing in the model assumes an expense has exactly one representation; an attachment is a child table added later, not a column added to `expenses`
- categories an operator can edit → **seam:** a category is already a row with an id, seeded, never an enum written into the code
- signing up, and resetting a password by mail → needs a mail sender, which this version does not declare. **Seam:** the password is already a one-way hash on the member of staff's own row, so a reset changes that row and touches nothing else

### Permanently out of scope

- more than one currency. Every amount is an integer number of yen, and no exchange rate, minor unit or currency column is designed for
- more than one company in one deployment. There is no tenant, and no row carries one
- a phone app, or any public API. There is exactly one consumer and it speaks GraphQL


## 5. Existing assets

Current implementation: none (new)
Treatment: build new — there is nothing to port and nothing to match
Authority: not applicable — no code exists for the spec to disagree with
Baseline: not applicable — nothing is inherited


## 6. Terminology and domain concepts

| Term | Description |
|---|---|
| expense | one payment a member of staff made and records: the date it was paid, the amount, a category and an optional memo |
| category | the fixed set an expense is filed under — transport, meals, supplies, other |
| month | the calendar month an expense's date falls in. The unit a list and a total are taken over |
| own entry | an expense recorded by the member of staff who is signed in. Nobody sees anybody else's |


## 7. Non-functional requirements

| Item | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Users at launch | 20 members of staff |
| Users foreseen | 50, within two years |
| The heaviest single operation | one member of staff's month — at most a few hundred rows read and summed. At the foreseen size it stays a single indexed read, and no total is stored |
| Response time | a month's entries and its total return in under one second at the foreseen size |
| Availability | office hours, best effort. No standby, and no uptime commitment |
| Data retention | an expense is kept for 7 years, for bookkeeping. Nothing expires automatically. An entry its owner removes is deleted outright rather than archived — what is retained is what remains |
| Security level | an ordinary internal business system. TLS in front, a session cookie, a one-way password hash |
| Authentication | every operation but `signIn` requires a session, and is refused before it reads anything without one |
| Authorization | every operation that touches an expense is scoped to the signed-in member of staff. Another member of staff's expense is answered as not found, never as forbidden |
| Personal data | a member of staff's name and email address, and a memo, which may name a client. None of the three is ever written to a log line, and no operation returns a password hash |


## 8. Manual verification

| Middleware | Version | profile | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| MariaDB | 10.5.12 | (default) | the primary data store |

**Redis is not declared, because this version runs no background job.** Every write finishes inside its own request, and nothing here leaves the process.


## 9. Data model
<!-- id: data-model -->
<!-- target: backend -->
<!-- depends: none -->

### 9.1 staff_members

| Column | Type | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| id | bigint | primary key | |
| name | varchar(191) | not null | what the signed-in member of staff is shown as |
| email | varchar(191) | not null, unique | the address the account was issued against |
| password_hash | varchar(191) | not null | a one-way hash. Never returned, never logged |
| created_at / updated_at | datetime(3) | not null | |

### 9.2 expense_categories

| Column | Type | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| id | int | primary key | |
| name | varchar(191) | not null, unique | transport, meals, supplies, other |
| display_order | int | not null | the order the four are offered in |
| created_at / updated_at | datetime(3) | not null | |

Seeded, not editable in this version. A category is a row with an id from the first migration, so making it editable later adds a screen and changes no other table.

### 9.3 expenses

| Column | Type | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| id | bigint | primary key | |
| staff_member_id | bigint | not null, indexed | the owner. Every read is scoped by it |
| expense_category_id | int | not null, indexed | |
| spent_on | date | not null | the day the money was paid, not the day it was recorded |
| amount | int | not null | yen. An integer, because the yen has no minor unit |
| memo | varchar(191) | null | optional |
| status | varchar(32) | not null | `recorded` for every row this version writes. The seam approval is built on |
| created_at / updated_at | datetime(3) | not null | |

Indexed on `(staff_member_id, spent_on)` — the one read that matters is one member of staff's month, and it is the heaviest operation this version has.

### Acceptance criteria
<!-- acceptance -->

- an expense row cannot be written without an owner, a category, a date and an amount
- two members of staff can hold the same email address in no circumstance
- the four categories exist after the seeder runs, in their display order
- an expense always names a member of staff who exists, and a category that exists


## 10. Sign in
<!-- id: sign-in -->
<!-- target: backend, frontend-staff -->
<!-- depends: data-model -->

### 10.1 Operations
<!-- id: sign-in-operations -->
<!-- target: backend -->

| schema | input | result | kind | caller |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `signIn` | `SignInInput(email, password)` | `SignInResult(staffMemberId)` | mutation | anyone. The one operation reachable without a session |
| `signOut` | `SignOutInput()` | `SignOutResult(signedOut)` | mutation | the signed-in member of staff |
| `signedInStaffMember` | `SignedInStaffMemberInput()` | `SignedInStaffMemberResult(staffMemberId, name, email)` | query | the signed-in member of staff, about themselves only |

`signedInStaffMember` exists because a session is a cookie: after a reload the screens have to ask whether they still have one, and who is holding it.

### 10.2 Screen
<!-- id: sign-in-screen -->
<!-- target: frontend-staff -->

For: a member of staff who is not signed in. It is the one screen reachable without a session, and every other screen sends somebody here when theirs has gone.

| Calls | Kind | When |
|---|---|---|
| `signIn` | mutation | on submitting the address and password |
| `signedInStaffMember` | query | on opening, to send an already-signed-in person on rather than asking twice |

### Use cases
<!-- usecases -->

- a member of staff opens the app on a Monday morning, signs in with the address and password they were issued, and is signed in — every screen after that knows who they are
- a member of staff who has finished on a shared machine signs out, and the next person to open the app is asked to sign in rather than landing in somebody else's account

### Acceptance criteria
<!-- acceptance -->

- an address with no account and a correct address with the wrong password are refused identically, and neither refusal says which of the two it was
- a session survives a page reload, and stops working the moment its holder signs out
- neither operation this feature adds returns a password or a password hash, and neither writes one into a log line
- `signedInStaffMember` called without a session is refused, and returns nobody


## 11. Expense entry
<!-- id: expense-entry -->
<!-- target: backend, frontend-staff -->
<!-- depends: sign-in -->

### 11.1 Operations
<!-- id: expense-entry-operations -->
<!-- target: backend -->

| schema | input | result | kind | caller |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `expenses` | `ExpensesInput(pagination)` | `ExpensesResult(expenses, pagination)` | query | the signed-in member of staff, own entries only |
| `expenseCategories` | `ExpenseCategoriesInput()` | `ExpenseCategoriesResult(expenseCategories)` | query | any signed-in member of staff |
| `recordExpense` | `RecordExpenseInput(spentOn, amount, expenseCategoryId, memo)` | `RecordExpenseResult(expenseId)` | mutation | any signed-in member of staff. The row is written against them |
| `correctExpense` | `CorrectExpenseInput(expenseId, spentOn, amount, expenseCategoryId, memo)` | `CorrectExpenseResult(expenseId)` | mutation | the owner of that expense, nobody else |
| `removeExpense` | `RemoveExpenseInput(expenseId)` | `RemoveExpenseResult(expenseId)` | mutation | the owner of that expense, nobody else |

Each mutation returns the identifier of what it wrote and nothing more; the screen re-reads through `expenses`.

### 11.2 Screen
<!-- id: expense-entry-screen -->
<!-- target: frontend-staff -->

For: a signed-in member of staff, looking at their own entries, most recent first.

| Calls | Kind | When |
|---|---|---|
| `expenses` | query | on opening, and after every write |
| `expenseCategories` | query | on opening, to fill the category field |
| `recordExpense` | mutation | on submitting the form |
| `correctExpense` | mutation | on submitting an entry that was opened for correction |
| `removeExpense` | mutation | on confirming a removal |
| `signOut` | mutation | on signing out |

### Use cases
<!-- usecases -->

- a member of staff who paid a 1,200 yen train fare on the way to a client records it that evening — the date, the amount, the category and a short memo — and sees it in their entries
- a member of staff who typed 12,000 instead of 1,200 opens that entry, corrects the amount, and what they see from then on is the corrected one
- a member of staff who recorded the same lunch twice removes the duplicate, and their entries no longer show it

### Acceptance criteria
<!-- acceptance -->

- an expense with no amount, an amount of zero, or a negative amount is refused, and nothing is recorded
- an expense dated after today is refused
- the memo is optional: an expense recorded without one is accepted, and reads back with an empty memo rather than failing
- correcting an entry changes it in place — the number of entries a member of staff has does not change
- a removed entry is gone from every later read, and removing it a second time changes nothing
- reading, correcting or removing an expense belonging to somebody else is answered as not found, and the answer says nothing about whether it exists
- every operation this feature adds is refused without a session, before it reads anything


## 12. Monthly summary
<!-- id: monthly-summary -->
<!-- target: backend, frontend-staff -->
<!-- depends: expense-entry -->

### 12.1 Operations
<!-- id: monthly-summary-operations -->
<!-- target: backend -->

| schema | input | result | kind | caller |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `monthlyExpenses` | `MonthlyExpensesInput(year, month)` | `MonthlyExpensesResult(expenses, totalAmount)` | query | the signed-in member of staff, own entries only |

One operation returns both the month's entries and its total, so that the two can never disagree, and so that the export foreseen for 1.2.0 calls this rather than summing again.

### 12.2 Screen
<!-- id: monthly-summary-screen -->
<!-- target: frontend-staff -->

For: a signed-in member of staff, reading one month at a time. The month it opens on is the current one.

| Calls | Kind | When |
|---|---|---|
| `monthlyExpenses` | query | on opening, and on moving to another month |

### Use cases
<!-- usecases -->

- a member of staff filing a claim at the end of the month picks that month, reads the total, and writes it on the claim form
- a member of staff checking last month against their card statement switches to the previous month and reads its entries without leaving the screen

### Acceptance criteria
<!-- acceptance -->

- the total shown equals the sum of the amounts of the entries shown, to the yen
- an expense dated the first or the last day of the chosen month is in that month; one dated the day before or the day after is not
- a month in which the member of staff recorded nothing shows a total of zero and says the month is empty, rather than an empty table
- an expense recorded, corrected or removed is reflected in the chosen month's total on the next read
- another member of staff's expense in the same month changes neither the entries shown nor the total
- the operation this feature adds is refused without a session, before it reads anything


## 13. Implementation plan

### Milestone 1 (MVP)

1. the data model, and the seeder that fills the four categories
2. sign in and sign out
3. recording, correcting and removing an expense, and reading back one's own entries
4. a chosen month's entries and their total

### Milestone 2

There is none. Everything this version builds is the MVP, and what follows it is a version of its own rather than a second milestone in this one.

### Fine to leave for later

- approval by a manager (1.1.0)
- exporting a month for a claim form (1.2.0)
- a photograph of the receipt
- categories an operator can edit
- signing up, and resetting a password by mail


## 14. Version acceptance criteria

### 1.0.0
<!-- id: version-acceptance-1-0-0 -->

- a member of staff signs in, records an expense dated today, and finds that expense counted in the current month's total
  spans: #sign-in, #expense-entry, #monthly-summary
- a member of staff who has signed out reaches neither their own entries nor any month's total until they sign in again
  spans: #sign-in, #expense-entry, #monthly-summary
- two members of staff signed in at the same time see neither each other's entries nor each other's totals, in any month
  spans: #sign-in, #expense-entry, #monthly-summary


## 15. Key file map

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `expense-note-backend/sequelize/migrations/` | the three tables, and the index on `(staff_member_id, spent_on)` |
| `expense-note-backend/sequelize/seeders/master/` | the four categories |
| `expense-note-backend/server/graphql/schemas/staff/` | the SDL of the seven operations |
| `expense-note-backend/server/graphql/resolvers/staff/actual/` | the resolvers, one file each |
| `expense-note-frontend-staff/app/pages/` | the three screens |

Placement is settled against the real tree `/hora-setup` reads; this table is what the spec knows before that.
